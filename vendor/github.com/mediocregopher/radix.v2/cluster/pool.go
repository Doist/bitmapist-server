// clusterPool wraps the normal pool fairly transparently. The major change
// being made is that, once Empty is called, all Put calls on clusterPool will
// always close the connection, never put it back in the pool like in the normal
// Pool implementation.
//
// A side effect is that Empty may only be called once.
//
// This is all to prevent a race condition in cluster's Put method, since
// retrieving the pool and calling Put on it aren't synchronous in there, so the
// pool could potentially be cleaned up after it's gotten but before Put is
// called on it.
