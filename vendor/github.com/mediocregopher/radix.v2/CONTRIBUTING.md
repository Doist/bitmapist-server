# MAKE AN ISSUE BEFORE YOU MAKE A PULL REQUEST PLEASE

It's hard to tell someone to throw away work they've done already, it's easy to
tell them beforehand there's already a solution to their problem and they don't
need to write a PR.

# Other rules

There's a couple. They're not even really rules, more just telling you what you
can expect.

* Issues are ALWAYS welcome, whether or not you think it's a dumb question or
  it's been asked before. I make a very real attempt to respond to all issues in
  24 hours. You can email me directly if I don't make this deadline.

* Pull requests for small bug fixes have the same rules as issues, just submit
  it and I'll get to it ASAP.

* The API never breaks. All PRs which aren't backwards compatible will not be
  accepted. Similarly, if I do commit something which isn't backwards compatible
  with an older behavior please submit an issue ASAP so I can fix it.
